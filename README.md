## Code Licensing
If I ever contributed to your project and you suddenly want to change its license, you are allowed to change it to MIT or any version of BSD or any version of GPLv2/LGPLv2 and later, without asking me for permission. THIS IS YOUR PERMISSION to do so FOLLOWING WHAT'S WRITTEN HERE! If you want to change it to any other please contact me via email so we could figure things out.
